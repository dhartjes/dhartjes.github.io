<h1>Dominic Hartjes - Software Developer</h1>
<h2>Tackling Complexity, Sharing Understanding</h2>

<p>This page will serve as my personal hub where I will share:
    <ul>
        <li>who I am</li>
        <li>my story as a software developer</li>
        <li>tools I am proficient in or learning</li>
        <li>articles that have helped me</li>
        <li>my coding experiments</li>
        <li>my current resume</li>
    </ul>

    My hope is that this will serve as a resource to other software developers as they branch out and discover new tools and technologies. Enjoy your stay!
